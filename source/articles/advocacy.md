The original sin of autistic self-advocates was renouncing their designated pre-death Limbo of concurrently being too autistic to be witty experts, and not autistic enough to be expert witnesses.

## Mission statement <!-- mission -->

We reserve – and arguably deserve – the right to only speak for and to ourselves, our whole selves, and nobody but our selves, so {% caps 'G.O.D.' %} help us,
{%- ref 'GOD' %}
invoking rhetorical devices such as humour, anger, satire, irony, sarcasm, parody, farce, conspiracy theories of mind, and pigeon English.
{%- ref 'farty-towels' %}

Sometimes we spontaneously lose our speech altogether and have to resort to writing. This condition is known and defined by employers, media outlets and healthcare professionals as being an 'antisocial arsehole' ({% caps 'AA' %}).

## The many straw lobbyists of exclusion <!-- exclusion -->

Because the false argument always points in the direction of the true cause.

### Straw children summoned by Autism Warrior Parents <!-- children -->

*You are not like my child* is the incessant broken record chant that Autism Warrior Parents invoke to insult those autistic children of other parents who had the audacity to become adults.
Already a decade ago, the absurdity of this imperishable ignorance was monumented by the autistic community blog 
{%- ref 'awp' %}
[*We Are Like Your Child*](https://wearelikeyourchild.blogspot.com/).

Caregivers advocating for segregation instead of inclusion of their supposedly severe/real autistics are put to shame by the 2021 must-see documentary 
[*This is not about me*](https://thisisnotaboutme.film/)
that chronicles how non-speaking autistic Jordyn Zimmerman started to thrive as an adult by using *Augmentative and Alternative Communication* 
({% caps 'AAC' %}) 
after having been denied an education for eighteen years by systemic bigotry.
{%- ref 'AAC' %}

### Angry straw advocates <!-- angry -->

*Spectrum*, an online glossy that modestly self-identifies as *the leading source* on autism research, published an exemplary showcase of great 
[choreographed drama](https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/autism-research-at-the-crossroads/) 
in January 2023. It has blushing academic damsels in distress, autistic social media warlords commandeering legions of angry flash mobsters,
{%- ref 'legion' %}
the entire future of science at stake, and plenty of both-sidisms. 

Autistic researcher Monique Botha crafted a prompt and appropriate rebuttal of this manipulative diatribe in a 
[Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/DrMBotha/status/1618274775608197120).
Their shallow appearance in the article could have easily been upgraded with some credit for and exploration of their topical yesteryear publication about the self-inflicted crisis of autism research.
{%- ref 'botha' %}
That's what we immediately recognized their name from, but then, we are not a leading source of anything.

### The straw brains of male extremists <!-- EMB -->

Enough said (is that [Baron-Cohen](/onboarding/#endnote-baroness) still being an influential persona in autism research in 2023 is akin to Trump still having prospects for presidency instead of incarceration).
{%- ref 'parentheses' %}

### Internalized straw communitists <!-- ableism -->

Not all activism is productive, but some autistic folks are so annoyed by autistic self-advocacy that they identify with the demagogic infant of 
[*not like my child* rhetorics](#children) 
and demand that everybody must cease and desist. This is not a discussion we engage in, because it inevitably ends up in a deadlock that sees the opposing sides accusing each other of toxic behaviour.

We have no particular affinity with *any* influencers who are broadcasting to a large following, usually on social media, but we think autistic people are just as entitled to build a personal brand and pursue vanity driven success as anybody else. Autistic self-advocates and activists with ample public exposure have often disappointed, sometimes annoyed, but never damaged us.

Marginalized people have complex histories and personalities, and internalized ableism is an omnipresent problem in the entire disability community. So is its intersection with envy, jealousy and self-indulgence. The healthy, self-care informed response to resolved collective self-harm by should-be peers is not **fight**, but **mourning** and **flight**.
{%- ref 'fight-or-flight' %}

## But is it really necessary to make a ruckus?

Yes. Check your privilege. 

Samples include the life threatening, its lack of quality, actual murder and pity for the killers, wrongful incarceration, physical and psychological child torture, immigration discrimination and academic racism.
