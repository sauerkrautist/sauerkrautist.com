The current universal diagnostic name for autism is {{ ASD }} ({% ASD %}), classified as a *neurodevelopmental disorder*. Significantly, this obsoleted 
[{{ AS }}](/asperger/) 
({% AS %}) as a distinct diagnosis. 

Beware of the confusing similarity of the abbreviations: lay persons might assume that {% AS %} is just a colloquial variation of {% ASD %} that kindly omits the insulting term **disorder**. {% ASD %} and {% AS %} refer to different things and **cannot** be used interchangeably.

The official name of the obsolete diagnosis in the {% cite DSM %} ({% DSM %}) is 
[{{ AD }}](/!/AD/) ({% AD %}). 
Even in countries that use the {% DSM %}, Asperger syndrome is the canonical **public** diagnostic label.

## Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ({% DSM %}) <!-- DSM -->

{% table {
  rows: [
    ['Publisher', APA + ' (' + _APA_ + ')'],
    ['Current version', _DSM5_ + ' (2013)'],
    [AD, _DSM4_ + ' (1994)']
  ]
} %}

Note that the {% DSM %} used roman numerals before version five. Both the {% DSM5 %} and {% caps 'DSM-IV' %} had later text revisions indicated with the suffix -{%caps 'TR' %} that are not relevant for the purpose of this page.

Our unromantic opinion: the {% DSM %} is a proprietary, heavily paywalled gatekeeping tool, developed by a corrupt organization that is 
[dominated by pharmaceutical industry lobbyists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychiatric_Association#Drug_company_ties), 
with the primary purpose of generating profit.

## International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ({% ICD %}) <!-- ICD -->

{% table {
  rows: [
    ['Publisher', WHO + ' (' + _WHO_ + ')'],
    ['Current version', _ICD_ + '-11 (endorsed 2019, effective 2022)'],
    ['Asperger syndrome', _ICD_ + '-10 (endorsed 1990, effective 1994)']
  ]
} %}

## How the difference between the {% DSM %} & {% ICD %} affect the international community

The nine year difference between the removal of {{ AS }} from the respective diagnostic tools is significant. For countries using the {% ICD %}, the diagnosis has only been obsolete for one full year, *and* it coincided with the {% COVID19 %} pandemic.
