*Don't Explain the Joke* they said. And then they don't *get* the joke.
So here's infodumping the subtext of 
[this site's subtitle](/#hell) 
at length.
{%- ref 'love' %}
To make this content more inclusive for persons without autism, we are prepeared to go very far out on a ledge and employ a diverse array of evidence-based psychological bonding strategies like 
[person-first language](#greek) ({% caps 'PFL' %}), 
<b>bold type</b> in body copy, Oxford commas, and 
[exclamation marks](#greek)!

And [mild xenophobia](#greek).
{%- ref 'greek' %}

## Academics! Endnotes! It's all Greek to me! <!-- greek -->

The term <b>autism</b> was coined in 1911 by a failed Swiss farmer called Eugen Bleuler.
{%- ref 'autism' %} 
It is derived from the Greek word *αὐτός*, meaning <b>self</b>.

The term <b>allism</b> was coined in 2003 by a non-allistic English software engineer called Andrew Main.
{%- ref 'allism' %} 
It is derived from the Greek word *ἄλλος*, meaning <b>other</b>.

The plot thickens!

## Sartre: “Hell is other people” <!-- hell -->

Few people have actually seen, read or listened to Jean-Paul Charles Aymard Sartre's seminal play 
*Huis clos<!-- fr -->*, 
but most people are familiar with its catchphrase
*L’enfer, c’est les autres<!-- fr -->*.
{%- ref 'sartre' %}

No single line in the history of playwriting has been as commonly misunderstood, and no single misunderstanding in the history of cognition has been as frequently mansplained.

The situation was so grave that the man himself took to his fountain pen and thus provided a clarification that was promptly misinterpreted as well (emphasis boldy ours):

{% quote {

  ref: 'sartre-on-theatre',
  year: 1976
} %}
But "Hell is <b>other</b> people" has always been misunderstood. It has been thought that what I meant by that was that our relations with <b>other</b> people ... are invariably hellish relations. But what I really mean is something totally different. ... Because <b>other</b> people are basically the most important means we have in our<b>selves</b> for our own knowledge of our<b>selves</b>. When we think about our<b>selves</b>, when we try to know our<b>selves</b>, basically we use knowledge of us which <b>other</b> people already have. We judge our<b>selves</b> with the means <b>other</b> people have given us for judging our<b>selves</b>. Into whatever I say about my<b>self</b> someone else's judgment always enters. Into whatever I feel within my<b>self</b> someone else's judgement enters. Which means that if my relations are bad, I am situating my<b>self</b> in a total dependence on someone else. And then I am indeed in hell. And there are a vast number of people in the world who are in hell because they are too dependent on the judgment of <b>other</b> people.
{% endquote %}

It shall be left as an exercise to the astute reader to replace *other* with *allistic* and *self*/*selves* with *autism* upon rereading.
{%- ref 'scarfolk' %}

We argue that Sartre's authoritative treatise on the topos of his own diction, invoking a brisk crossfire of clever allusions to Greek pathological jargon that is hitherto unprecedented in the canon of existentialistic discourse, emerges as a relentless deconstruction of internalized ableism as an oppressive social construct that is facilitated by psychiatric diagnosis as the quintessential manifestation of human judgement, and thus reminds us that for autistic people, hell is indeed allistic people.

    This must be what allistics refer to as "fighting fire with fire".

    Born to a rich farmer, Eugen lacked the mental and physical strength that is a prerequisite for an outdoor life, so he fully embraced his *eugenics* namesake and pursued a career in academia.

    If you came here for the English translation of his famous catchphrase, learn French, you barbarian, or

    For cocktail parties, existential enlightenment is to be served with

    on the side. The aura of mystery when citing Sartre is never to be dilluted with source references.
