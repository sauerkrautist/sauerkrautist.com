Hans Asperger is an elusive confidence trickster who goes by many aliases. The epynomous post-mortem diagnosis commonly known by its {% ICD %} monniker *Asperger syndrome*, its initialism {% AS %}, its {% DSM4 %} label *Asperger's disorder*, its initialisn {% caps 'AD' %}, its short forms *Asperger’s* or even *Aspergers* (is that, like, *The Kardashians*?), and its diminutive *aspie* with its open compound words like *aspie culture* and *aspie community*. 

And let's not forget about the *Asperburgers* (hat tip to Remi Yergeau).

## Bring your own rose-coloured glasses <!-- {{ SECTION_ID }} -->

On the surface, Asperger syndrome marks the beginning of a golden age for autistic people. Communities are born, and amplified by the co-occuring rise of the internet.
The seeds of neurodiversity are planted.
{%- ref 'singer' %}

But the inception of 'high-functioning' autistics -- who are not only no burden to, but even potentially **benefitial** to society and the economy -- driving into the sunset leaves behind an inevitable residue trail of low-functioning autistics who are **nothing but** a burden.

The devastating depth and debt of this factually ill-conceived divergence comes to a full circle when we witness in the year

## 2018: A Renazification Odyssey

As if the the long standing diagnostic vacuum created by the divergence between the 
{% DSM %} and {% ICD %} after 2013 wasn't bad enough, Asperger's rather inexplicably positive public image took a painful nose dive when in 2018 historians Hans Czech and Edith Sheffer independently published evidence of Asperger's voluntary involvement in involuntary euthanasia of his supposedly low-functioning patients.
{%- ref 'renazification' %}

Here is cashing in on that [promise of a full circle](#{{ SECTION_ID }}).

### The fascistic inertia of progress

Asperger's *little professors* are exclusively **white**, **male**, and **speaking**. The antonyms of these attributes -- and their intersection multipliers -- add low-functioning points to the diagnostic scorecard up to present day, with some minor progress achieved for white, speaking women.

### Conspiracy theories

Unfortunately Nazi caricatures sell well. The internet being a bold mixture of asinine conspiracy theorists and children playing telephone,
{%- ref 'telephone' %} we have encountered the most absurd supervillain fabrications about Asperger secretly conducting gruesome experiments on his young patients for sinister goals,
even from folks who usually succeed in {% cite 'Keeping Up Appearances' %}.
{%- ref 'appearances' %}

Disengage.<sup>(2nd of 3)</sup>

The bare factual evidence brought forward by Czech is quite bad enough. As far as Sheffer is concerned, we first need to talk about

### 2015: *Neurotribes* by Steve Silberman

Published three years before Czech's article and Sheffer's book, Silberman's bestseller *Neurotribes* now appears tainted by its romanticized, heroic picture of Asperger to most people who are familiar with the matter. It is fair to note that this was not his invention but an evolution of prior art.
{%- ref 'fanboys' %}

In a 2018 interview Silberman talked at length about the incremental research period for his book:
{%- ref 'interview' %}

{% quote {
  author: 'Steve Silberman',
  year: 2018
} %}
Then I saw a reference to Herwig Czech, ... I wrote to him and asked him to tell me what he knew about Asperger and the Nazis. He ... promised to share the information he had when he was done with a book in several months. I didn’t hear from him. Over the next several years, I wrote to him six more times, ... Each time, Czech apologized for the delay and assured me that he’d eventually share what he knew.

Not until I read a review of my book by Simon Baron-Cohen, and an advance reading copy of “In a Different Key,” did I realize that Czech had shared his information exclusively with the authors of that book and Baron-Cohen. But even then, when I asked Czech to tell me what he knew so that I could revise the text of “NeuroTribes” in a timely manner, he refused, telling me that he wanted to first publish the information under his own name.
{% endquote %}

In a capitalist society, scoops equal money, and money equals status. 

We are historically biased. For us, Silberman's book emerged as a much needed springboard towards an affirmitive view of autism when we needed one after our diagnosis.

But all things being unequal, we are very receptive to the autistic feminist view that *Neurotribes* as a whole serves to reinforce an existing history that is branded extremely male.
{%- ref 'binary-boys' %}

### 2018: *Asperger's Children* by Edith Sheffer

Historical accounts of autistic pathology are in dire need of female authors, and Sheffer is at her best when she zooms in on history that men have casually brushed and glossed over. Our biggest takeaway here is the stark -- in some cases literally fatal -- difference in Asperger's treatment of girls who are denied diagnostic salvation despite showcasing all the characteristics of his little male professors.
{%- ref 'girls-and-boys' %}

This could have been a great book about child psychiatry building up to and during Nazi Vienna, but we grew tired of its namesake chracter being summoned as a marketing MacGuffin that stitches too much anecdata toegether with ominous *would have*s.

On the literal last two pages, in the acknowledgements, Sheffer discloses herself as an Autism Warrior Parent.
{%- ref 'sheffer-warrior-parent' %}
Her personal anti-diagnosis agenda is rejected by Czech,
{%- ref 'czech-response' %}
but warmly embraced by the ususual suspects and hate mongers.
{%- ref 'escher' %}

Finally, we are not amused that a book as recent as Sheffer's, that is marketed with the sensationalist subtitle *The Origins of Autism in Nazi Vienna*, has nothing to offer but a shared endnote in its introduction for Jewish Soviet child psychiatrist Grunya Sukhareva's 1925 publication.
{%- ref 'sukhareva' %} 
Its German translation from 1926 predating Asperger's seminal work by a whopping *eighteen years*, we are inclined to think that this would have been the book's one redeeming use case for things Asperger *would have been aware&nbsp;of*.

### Conclusion

We think that in present day, *Neurotribes* and *Asperger’s Children* should be canonically sold as a bundle. Whichever you happen to read first for whatever reason, you deserve the other.

## A call to no action

In the very front row of things one does not ever do sits gaslighting marginalized groups into feeling responsible for and remediating the damage done by their privileged oppressors.

### Send In The Psychiatrists {%- ref 'clowns' %}

When career academics accidentally summon the demons of Nazi Germany while digging for diagnostic novelty in the stinking shitpile that is psychiatric history, *they* are the accountable party. This isn't college. 

Yet the best they come up with is telling people that their diagnosis has been accidentally lost in a hostile takeover, and that the second identity they had to build from scratch was yet another Shakespearean Comedy of Errors, 
{%- ref 'shakespeare' %}
but this time with fascists and genocide. Here's a candy and a discount coupon for more therapy.

### Just let it go

Eventually Asperger syndrome will wither away like that auld acquaintance who has been forgot.
{%- ref 'auld-lang-syne' %}
It does not help to jeer from the sidelines at human beings still wearing the Scarlet Letters {% AS %} upon their chest for reasons unbeknownst to us. Read the book, 
{%- ref 'scarlet-letter' %} 
check your privilege -- and the [diverging timelines](/pathology/) of the institutions that own your identity -- and let it go. 

If you are as upset as we are and feel the existential **need** to raise your leg to take a piss at the bark of a tree, at least do your due diligence and find a tree to bark at and a window to smash in a university backyard.

Victim blaming is **never** okay, mkay. 

  **There are no exceptions**.

    Chapter one has a curious air of defensiveness, reading as if being written **after** Czech and Sheffer, not **five years before** Silberman, calling character witnesses for the "great pioneer" Asperger. 
    
    Asperger's daugther refers to his "Nazi criticism" in a diary entry and an "unpublished article" in 1934. A female post-war colleague describes him as welcoming and "interested in what you had to say", before the plot quickly thickens to absurdity (Feinstein, 2010, page 15):
    {% quote %}
      Once, Wurst handed Asperger a manuscript she had written and he said to her: "Why have you got so much paper dirty? Why are you quoting other people writing about autism? My ideas are good enough."
    {% endquote %}

    We are then teased to comic relief (page 16) because

    {% quote %}
      Some critics have claimed that his thesis was consistent with the eugenic approach, as set out by Hamburger. This appears to be a serious misconception.
    {% endquote %}

    And the sceptical reader is about to learn (page 16) that

    {% quote %}
      A PhD student, Marc Bush, has carried out a very detailed stylistic analysis of Asperger’s papers of 1938 and 1944 and believes that Asperger deliberately couched them in “Nazi-style” vocabulary to deceive the Nazis, while protecting the children in his charge in Vienna.
    {% endquote %}

    Feinman then continues to quote pythonesque "evidence" from 
    [Asperger's 1938 lecture](/asperger/das-psychisch-abnorme-kind/)
    that is also prominently referred to by [Anna de Hooge](#endnote-binary-boys).

      Besides, Hans Asperger is but one figure in the system that is Aspie supremacy. The cooperation between Czech, Baron-Cohen and Silberman serves as a painful reminder of this fact. I am hesitant to expect more than superficial change to come from a paper finalized under the approving eye of both an editor-in-chief famous for conceptualizing Asperger's as extreme male intelligence, and a reviewer who uncritically applauded Asperger for his utilitarian argument.
