Are you a late-certified autistic adult? Is your psychoeducation homework littered with 
*Extreme Male Brain* farts that did not age well?

Welcome on board.
We warmly recommend treating yourselves to quality resources that are authored by autistic comrades exclusively, exclusively.

## Three cornerstones of a positive self-view

Autism theories and reasearch need autistic people. After more than half a century of fruitless eugenics-informed pathologizing, the last two decades have slowly given rise to autistic academics who have created mental models that are actually helpful for the autistic population.

### 1. The Double Empathy Problem

In 2012, autism researcher Damian Milton published an article that convincingly explained social and communication barriers between autistic and allistic people as a bidirectional problem.
{%- ref 'milton' %} 

Many of the problems that autistic folks encounter in their present-day-to-day life continue to originate from this lack of understanding. Get a foot in that door whenever you can. The 
[Double empathy problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_empathy_problem) 
article on Wikipedia is a good starting point for further reading.

### 2. Monotropism

The webpage 
[Monotropism - Explanations](https://monotropism.org/explanations/)
features a wonderful narrated animation that introduces this theory of autism by researchers Dinah Murray and Wenn Lawson without the academic baggage.

For ourselves, the power of monotropic attention tunnels is akin to the cliched trope of a superpower that is dangerous if you do not learn to understand and control it.

### 3. Neurodiversity

A term originally coined in and for the Aspie community by sociologist Judy Singer in 1998,
{%- ref 'singer' %}
*neurodiversity* has expanded to encompass a general, unbiased acknowledgement of the neurological diversity in humans.

It can be – and frequently is – the foundation of advocacy and activism for the acceptance and rights of neurodivergent people. 
The webpage 
[Neurodiversity: Some basic terms & definitions](https://neuroqueer.com/neurodiversity-terms-and-definitions/)
by Nick Walker does exactly what it says on the tin and also clears up several common misunderstandings.

    Sir Simon Philip Baron-Cohen, accomplished knight of the square White Old Mansplainers table

    *Theory of Mind* ({% ToM %}).
    He remains an influential force in autism research, and rumour has it that he is seeking legal action against Despair<sup>®</sup> for plagiarizing the intellectual property of his lifetime achievements with their
